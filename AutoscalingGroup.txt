problem: why can't I use an updated version of the launch template (I think the IAM permission is limited)

Copy the DNS of CapstoneProject-LB and paste it in a browser tab
Result: Website loads successfully and click on query to verify data can be queried
Successful!

Another method to crosscheck:
go to ASG, edit subnets to Public Subnet 1 and 2, and click on the instances created by the ASG titled "Wendy-CapstoneProject, stop and restart, no data will show, 
Go back and select Private Subnets 1 and 2 and restart the instances.

Complete.
