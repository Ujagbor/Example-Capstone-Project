# Example-Capstone-Project
Designing and deploying a robust and secure company website that returns data from the query page.  
This project was solely on cost optimization, autoscaling, and security by selecting and making use of the most efficient computing resources when initializing processes, which could always be scaled up in case of business growth.
Installed a LAMP web server to deliver a high-performance web application.
I opened port 80 from the security group of the Cloud9 EC2 instance so that I as well as anyone could access the website.
